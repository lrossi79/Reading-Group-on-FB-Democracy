<title>Reading group on 2023 Facebook paper</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>In summer 2023 a group of 4 papers have been published on Science and Nature to report the result of an unprecedented collaborative effort between Meta and a group of selected US researchers to investigate the impact of social media on various democratic processes with a specific focus on 2020 US election. </p>

<p>These papers represent a unique example of research both for the extent of the collaboration between Meta and the researchers (that went beyond the simple data-access) as well as for the results they reported that suggest a minimal (if not negligble) effect of Facebook on the US democratic process.</p>

<h1>Aim of the reading group</h1>
<p>Since the devil is in the details and since these paper are massive pieces of complex research a reading group seems a good opportunity to tackle both the methodological aspects as well as the main results. 
The idea is to dscuss these papers from a methodological, theoretical as well as political point of view. 

The plan is to discuss each paper individually and to allocate an extra day to discuss the more general questions such as data access and the politics of collaboration with social media platforms.
</p>

<h1>Agenda</h1>
<p>The meeting will on both on physical locations as well as on zoom. Since people from different universities have shown interest in this idea, they will take care of the local organization. All the different rooms will join a Zoom meeting at the following address: <a href="https://itucph.zoom.us/j/8280886718">https://itucph.zoom.us/j/8280886718</a><p>
